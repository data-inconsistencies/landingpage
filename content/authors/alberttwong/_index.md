Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently at Redis, where I bring together deep technical expertise and go-to-market strategy from both sides of the software ecosystem. Iâ€™ve led and contributed in Sales Engineering and Developer Relations roles at high-growth startups and industry leadersâ€”including Onehouse (a Databricks competitor), CelerData (open-source Snowflake alternative), MongoDB, Red Hat, and IBM. Along the way, Iâ€™ve partnered with innovative teams at companies like Michelin, Plaid, Visa, Costco, Home Depot, Target, Palo Alto Networks, Disney, and Coinbase. Earlier in my career, I was on the customer side, working closely with engineering and data teams at Honda R&D and Blue Shield of California. I also have taught Computer Science classes at Cal Poly Pomona and have 3 US patents. I thrive at the intersection of tech, storytelling, and customer success.
